Line_Zen_Palash

The deadline received for this project was too tight, as 2 days is extremely tough to handle & complete a project. Because from a developer’s side, 
a good project requires him to create proper architecture 1st, then the flow of the complete project, & next to create interfaces, design-patterns 
and the abstract classes on which the project will be structured, and then he can actually dive into coding maintain all above criterias.

As I need to do all these in 2 days, including to 1st understand the game mechanics by playing the game for sometime, I have tried my best to follow 
the most suitable design-pattern & possible structured code in the time provided. Though I personally can see few places to improve, but I guess that 
could have been achieved in little more time.

The things which I implemented in the game:-
•	Core Game Mechanic
•	Game Physics (movement, collisions, forces)
•	6 type of hurdles added (with more time could have added more variant)
•	Generic game difficulty levels
•	Swipe sensitivity control
•	Images created in Photoshop including paths
•	Tutorial & option of that in settings
•	Necessary UI’s, like Menu, Settings screen, Pause
•	Code architecture using Singleton, Scriptable Objects, Manager-Zone-Controller (like MVC) pattern & S.O.L.I.D principle as far as can in prescribed time.
•	Module wise folder structure
•	Code-comments added for better understanding whereas needed.
